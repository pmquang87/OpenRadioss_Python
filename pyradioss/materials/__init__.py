"""
pyradioss.materials — constitutive laws.

Fortran origin: ``engine/source/materials/mat/matXXX/sigepsXX.F``. In
OpenRadioss every material law is a routine ``SIGEPS<law>`` receiving the
strain-rate components and the old stress of a *group* of elements and
returning the new stress (plus updated internal variables and the sound
speed). The element kernels call it once per integration point per cycle.

The port keeps that contract exactly (vectorized over the group):

    law01_elastic.solid_update / shell_update        (LAW1)
    law02_johnson_cook.solid_update / shell_update   (LAW2)
    law36_tabulated.solid_update / shell_update      (LAW36)
    law27_brittle.shell_update                       (LAW27, shells only)
    law42_ogden.solid_update                         (LAW42, solids only)

Stress storage convention (Voigt, engineering shear):
    solids : (n, 6)  = [xx, yy, zz, xy, yz, zx]
    shells : (n, 3)  = [xx, yy, xy]   (in-plane; transverse shear handled
                                       elastically by the shell kernel)
Strain increments use the same ordering, with *engineering* shear
(gamma = 2*eps) exactly like the Fortran EPSPXX/EPSPXY arguments.

The objective (Jaumann) rotation of the old stress is done by the element
kernel BEFORE calling the law — same split as the Fortran, where SROTA3.F
rotates the stress and SIGEPS only integrates the constitutive rate.
(Hyperelastic laws — LAW42 — overwrite the stress from the deformation
gradient instead, so the pre-rotation is harmless for them.)

The ``extra`` argument (M3)
---------------------------
Some laws carry state beyond (sig, epsp), or need kinematic context
beyond the strain increment. The Fortran passes dozens of UVAR/extra
arguments; the port passes one ``extra`` dict of per-slice array views:

* ``extra_shapes(mat, nip)`` tells the element kernels which persistent
  per-element (per-layer for shells) arrays a law needs; the kernels
  allocate them in the group state under ``mat_extra`` and slice them
  into ``extra`` at call time.
* ``needs_defgrad(mat)`` asks for the deformation gradient: the solid
  kernels then compute F exactly from the stored initial shape-function
  gradients each cycle and pass it as ``extra["F"]``.
* shell kernels always add ``extra["layfail"]`` (the shared layer-failure
  array — see pyradioss.failure) so a law can break layers (LAW27).

``solid_update`` returns (sig, epsp, c) where c is a per-element sound
speed array, or None to keep the kernel's constant elastic estimate.
This is the Fortran SOUNDSP output: laws whose tangent stiffness can
exceed the ground-state one (LAW42 at large stretch!) MUST return the
true current sound speed or the Courant time step is not a bound.
