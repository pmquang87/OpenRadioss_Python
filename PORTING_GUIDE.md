# Porting guide — OpenRadioss (Fortran) → `pyradioss` (Python)

This document is the working map of the port: how the original source tree
translates to this repository, what is already ported, the conventions used,
and the roadmap for the remaining work. **Read this first if you plan to
extend the code.**

---

## 1. Architecture recap

OpenRadioss is two programs sharing data through a *restart file*:

```
            MYRUN_0000.rad                MYRUN_0001.rad
                 │                              │
                 ▼                              ▼
   ┌──────────────────────┐   restart   ┌──────────────────────┐
   │        STARTER        │ ─────────► │        ENGINE         │
   │  read + check + init  │  .rst      │  explicit time loop   │
   └──────────────────────┘             └──────────────────────┘
        MYRUN_0000.out                MYRUN_0001.out, T01, ANIM
```

The Engine's heart (`engine/source/engine/resol.F`, ~5000 lines) performs, per
cycle: element internal forces → contact forces → external loads → kinematic
conditions → acceleration/velocity/position update → time-step computation →
output. `pyradioss/engine/engine.py` reproduces exactly this sequence with the
same names in comments.

## 3. Conventions used in this port

1. **Every module docstring names its Fortran origin** and explains the theory
   (with textbook references: Belytschko–Liu–Moran for the corotational shell
   and hourglass control, Wilkins for the radial return, etc.).
2. **Structure of arrays, not array of structures.** Elements of one type are
   processed as NumPy arrays over the whole group — the Python analogue of the
   Fortran element-group loops (`NGROUP`/`MVSIZ` blocks). Scalar per-element
   Python loops are avoided except in setup code.
3. **IDs vs indices.** Decks use arbitrary user IDs; the Starter converts all
   of them to dense 0-based indices (the original does the same via `USR2SYS`
   tables). Arrays in the Engine are indexed, never keyed by user ID; the
   mapping is kept for output.
4. **Explicit is explicit.** No hidden state: each cycle recomputes forces
   from (x, v, internal state). All mutable element state (stress, plastic
   strain, hourglass forces…) lives in per-group `state` dictionaries created
   by the Starter.
5. **Units**: consistent-unit philosophy identical to Radioss — the solver
   never converts units; the deck must be consistent (e.g. mm, ms, kg → kN).
6. **Failure behaviour**: readable exceptions from the Starter for model
   errors (`StarterError`, with the same "** ERROR" flavour as the listing);
   the Engine protects against divergence with an energy-error stop criterion
   like the original (`/STOP` defaults).

### Solver features

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Explicit central-difference integration | ✅ |
| Element time step with scale factor, bulk viscosity | ✅ |
| Exact per-element eigenvalue bound on dt (port improvement: the classic lc/c estimate is up to ~40% above the true one-point-element stability limit; the Starter computes the exact eigenvalue correction once per element — 6×6 for solids, membrane **and** bending/shear branches for shells since M2, the full 12×12 for beams — see `solid_hexa8._exact_dt_factor`, `shell_bt4._bend_shear_omega2`, `beam_type3._exact_dt`) | ✅ |
| Solid hexa8, 1-point, Flanagan–Belytschko hourglass control | ✅ |
| Solid tetra4, constant strain (no hourglass modes; plain formulation — nodal-pressure Itetra variants ❌) | ✅ |
| Belytschko–Tsay 4-node shell (memb/bend/shear, BLT84 **stiffness** hourglass control since M2 — M1's viscous form artificially damped coarse dynamic bending) | ✅ |
| C0 3-node triangle shell (CST membrane + Mindlin plate, no hourglass modes) | ✅ |
| Corotational Timoshenko beam (axial/2×shear/torsion/2×bending resultants) | ✅ (LAW1 elastic; LAW2 via the global resultant-plasticity model since M3 — yields at exactly W·σy, no elastic-core spread to the 1.5·W·σy hinge; fiber-integrated TYPE18 beam is a roadmap item) |
| Degenerated /BRICK → tetra conversion, penta/pyramid clear check | 🟡 |
| Truss, linear spring | ✅ |
| Jaumann objective stress update | ✅ |
| LAW1, LAW2 (3D + plane stress) | ✅ |
| LAW36 tabulated plasticity (3D + plane stress, rate curve family) | ✅ |
| LAW27 brittle cracking (fixed smeared crack, unilateral damage) | 🟡 (elastic-brittle; original's plastic block ❌) |
| LAW42 Ogden hyperelasticity (total-strain from exact F, nonlinear SOUNDSP → dt) | 🟡 (solids only) |
| /FAIL element deletion plumbing (per-layer for shells, GBUF%OFF, deleted elements keep mass, drop stress/hourglass/dt claim, OFF field in ANIM, deletion count in the listing) | ✅ |
| Equations of state (/EOS) for solids | ❌ (deliberately deferred — see roadmap M6: needs energy-dependent pressure integration per element, out of M3's scope; pressure is currently always the law's own, i.e. linear K·tr(ε) for LAW1/2/36) |
| Rigid wall (kinematic, slide/tied) | ✅ |

| TYPE2 tied contact (kinematic; zero-work by construction — asserted in tests) | ✅ (translations; no rotation tying) |
| TYPE11 edge-to-edge penalty contact | ✅ |
| Contact ⇄ element deletion (M3⇄M4): segments/edges of `off == 0` elements drop out per cycle, secondary nodes with no surviving element stop being tracked, tied pairs release | ✅ |
| Interface time step: static node-on-spring bound + per-cycle accumulation of NEAR candidate spring stiffness per node (dt ≤ √(2m/ΣK) — springs stack at corners and in self-impact; proven by /DT 0.9 long-run impacts for Istf 0/2/5) | ✅ |
| Contact energy booked at the leapfrog midstep velocity (an M4 lesson: booking f·v at the pre-update velocity leaves a positive-definite f²dt²/2m residual per cycle that reads as energy creation when penalty springs dominate the scale — the midstep booking closes the balance to round-off) | ✅ |
| Energy balance (int/kin/hourglass/contact/external work), error % | ✅ |
| T01 time history, ANIM (as VTK), listings | ✅ |
| MPI/domain decomposition, SMP | ❌ (out of scope) |

## 5. Roadmap (next milestones)

1. **M2 — element completeness** ✅ (done): `/SH3N` (C0 triangle), 4-node
   tetra, beams (`/BEAM` + `/PROP/TYPE3`, elastic), degenerate-brick
   handling, shell hourglass upgraded from viscous to BLT84 stiffness
   type, exact-dt coverage extended to the shell bending/shear branch and
   the beam 12×12 eigenproblem. Deferred to later milestones:
   fully-integrated solid (Isolid=17 equivalent), QEPH shell, DKT18
   triangle, plastic beams (global plasticity model), nodal-pressure
   tetra variants.
2. **M3 — materials** ✅ (done): LAW36 tabulated plasticity (/FUNCT
   hardening curves + strain-rate curve family), LAW27 brittle cracking
   (shells), LAW42 Ogden hyperelasticity (solids, with the law feeding
   its **nonlinear sound speed** into the element time step — the M2
   time-step lesson applied to a stiffening material, proven by a long
   /DT 0.9 hold at λ≈2), /FAIL/JOHNSON and /FAIL/BIQUAD with full
   element-deletion plumbing (per-layer shell failure, OFF in ANIM,
   deletion messages), eps_p_max deletion for LAW2/LAW36, and the
   deferred-from-M2 plastic beams (LAW2 global resultant plasticity).
   Deferred out of M3, explicitly:
   * **/EOS (equations of state)** — energy-dependent pressure
     integration (E-p coupling per element, relative-volume state) is a
     solver-loop change, not just a material: it moves to M6 together
     with the thermal Johnson–Cook terms it usually accompanies;
   * thermal terms of LAW2//FAIL/JOHNSON (no thermal solution yet);
   * the plastic block of LAW27, shell LAW42, LAW42 Prony viscosity;
   * /FAIL/BIQUAD M-flag presets and S-flag; LAW36 Fsmooth/Fscale;
   * fiber-integrated beams (/PROP/TYPE18) for true plastic-hinge
     spread.
3. **M4 — contact** ✅ (done): TYPE7 full options — Istf 0–5 stiffness
   variants from the element formulas of i7sti3 (shell 0.5·E·t, solid
   B·A²/V), Igap constant/variable gaps with Gap_min/Gap_max, self-impact
   (grnod = 0), and a voxel broad phase replacing M1's all-pairs box
   test; TYPE2 tied contact (kinematic constraint: constant-weight
   projection with a co-rotating offset frame, lumped mass/force
   transfer — momentum-exact and zero-work by construction, both
   asserted); TYPE11 edge-to-edge penalty on /LINE edge sets (exact
   segment-segment closest points). Contact ⇄ /FAIL deletion is fully
   plumbed through per-segment element provenance: crack faces stop
   carrying contact, orphaned nodes stop being tracked, tied pairs
   release (the notched-plate example now runs a self-impact interface
   through full ligament tearing at ~0% energy error). Two hard-won
   solver lessons are recorded in the code: the interface dt must see
   the SUM of the candidate spring stiffnesses per node (springs stack
   at corners/self-impact — i7's STIFN accumulation), and contact work
   must be booked at the leapfrog midstep velocity or the balance reads
   spurious energy creation. Deferred out of M4, explicitly:
   * Inacti initial-penetration treatments and the stiffening
     K·p/(gap−p) near-crossing guard of the original force law;
   * Igap 2/3 (mesh-size-scaled gaps), Tstart/Tstop, sensors,
     Ifric > 0 friction models, thermal contact;
   * TYPE2 rotational-DOF tying (Spotflag) and the moment
     redistribution of offset ties; penalty-formulation TYPE2;
   * TYPE19/24/25 style combined interfaces;
   * parallel-edge overlap force distribution for TYPE11 (resultant is
     right, distribution acts at the closest-point pair).
4. **M5 — constraints & loads**: /RBODY, /RBE2/RBE3, /MPC, /SECT, moving and
   spherical/cylindrical rigid walls, /PLOAD, /IMPDISP.
5. **M6 — engine niceties**: /DT/NODA/CST mass scaling, restarts
   (`_0002.rad` chaining), /STATE, sensors, /DAMP, /EOS + thermal
   material terms (deferred from M3), ALE/CFD (long term).
6. **M7 — performance**: optional numba/JAX backends behind the same API.

## 6. Validation strategy

`tests/` contains two layers:

* **Unit tests** — parser round-trips, single-element material/element checks
  (e.g. one brick under uniaxial strain must return the analytic stress).
* **Analytic validations** — full starter+engine runs compared to closed-form
  results: longitudinal wave speed in a bar, cantilever/plate vibration
  frequency, Johnson–Cook uniaxial yield curve, energy conservation of a
  block bouncing on a rigid wall.

When porting new features, always add at least one analytic validation — this
is how the port stays trustworthy without bit-for-bit comparison against the
Fortran solver (which the different output formats make impractical).
